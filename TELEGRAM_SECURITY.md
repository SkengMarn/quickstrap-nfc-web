## Important Notes

⚠️ **Use Only in Private Chats**
- Always use the bot in a **private chat** with the bot
- Never login in group chats (even with auto-delete)
- The bot should only be used one-on-one

🔐 **Message Deletion**
- Messages are deleted using Telegram's API
- Deletion happens immediately after bot receives the message
- This works in private chats (one-on-one with the bot)

✅ **Secure by Design**
- No passwords stored in code
- No credentials in logs
- No message history of sensitive data
- Database stores only encrypted session tokens

## Testing the Security

Try it yourself:

1. Open Telegram and find **@quickstrapbot**
2. Send `/login`
3. Enter your email - watch it disappear!
4. Enter your password - watch it disappear!
5. Check your chat history - no credentials visible ✅

## Technical Details

### How Auto-Delete Works

1. User sends email/password message
2. Bot receives the webhook with message content
3. Bot **immediately** calls `deleteMessage` API
4. Message vanishes from chat (usually < 1 second)
5. Bot processes the credentials securely
6. Credentials are never stored, only used for auth

### API Used

```typescript
// Telegram deleteMessage API
POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/deleteMessage
{
  "chat_id": chatId,
  "message_id": messageId
}
```

### Code Location

File: `supabase/functions/telegram-webhook/index.ts`

Lines:
- 130-152: `deleteMessage()` function
- 207: Delete email message
- 225: Delete password message

## Privacy Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use the bot in private one-on-one chats
- Verify you're chatting with the correct bot (@quickstrapbot)
- Use a strong password
- Logout when done (`/logout`)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't use the bot in group chats
- Don't share your login credentials with others
- Don't login on public/shared devices without logging out

## FAQ

**Q: Will I see my password after I send it?**
A: No! It's deleted instantly. You might see it for a split second, but it will disappear.

**Q: Can someone else see my password before it's deleted?**
A: In a private one-on-one chat with the bot, only you can see messages. The deletion happens within 1 second of sending.

**Q: What if the deletion fails?**
A: The bot logs if deletion fails. In private chats, this is extremely rare. Still, only use the bot in private chats as an extra precaution.

**Q: Is my password stored anywhere?**
A: No. Your password is only used to authenticate with Supabase Auth. It's never stored by the bot. Supabase stores a hashed version for authentication.

**Q: Can the bot owner see my password?**
A: No. The password is only used for Supabase Auth and is immediately discarded. It doesn't appear in logs.

**Q: How do I know the message was deleted?**
A: You'll see your email/password message disappear from the chat immediately after sending. The bot will also confirm with "Email received and deleted for security!"
