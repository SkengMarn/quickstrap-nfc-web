## What's New vs. What Existed

### Previously (Limited)

❌ Basic `event_series` table with minimal fields
❌ No series-specific gates
❌ No series-specific categories
❌ Basic wristband assignment only
❌ No lifecycle management
❌ No recurring series support
❌ No templates
❌ No metrics caching
❌ Limited validation

### Now (Comprehensive)

✅ **Full lifecycle management** - draft → scheduled → active → completed → cancelled
✅ **Series-specific gates** - Assign gates independently per series
✅ **Series-specific categories** - Independent capacity limits and pricing
✅ **Advanced wristband assignments** - Validation statuses, bulk operations, access tracking
✅ **Recurring series** - Automatically generate daily/weekly/monthly instances
✅ **Templates system** - Reusable configurations for common patterns
✅ **Analytics caching** - Pre-computed metrics for performance
✅ **Location overrides** - Series can have different venues
✅ **Audit trails** - Complete state transition logging
✅ **Ticket integration** - Link tickets to specific series
✅ **Access verification** - Real-time validation during check-ins
✅ **Helper functions** - 15+ database functions for business logic
✅ **Security** - Comprehensive RLS policies

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Day Events
Create independent series for each day with different:
- Gates
- Capacity limits
- Categories
- Check-in windows
- Locations

**Example**: 3-day music festival with separate series for Friday, Saturday, Sunday

### 2. Tournament Management
Support complex tournament structures:
- Knockout rounds
- Group stages
- Round-robin formats
- Custom brackets

**Example**: Sports tournament with Quarter Finals, Semi Finals, Finals

### 3. VIP/Special Sessions
Create exclusive series within main events:
- VIP pre-parties
- Backstage access sessions
- Meet & greets
- After parties

**Example**: VIP After Party requiring separate validation

### 4. Recurring Events
Generate multiple instances automatically:
- Weekly concerts
- Monthly meetups
- Daily activities
- Custom patterns

**Example**: 16-week season of Thursday night games

### 5. Season Passes
Support complex access patterns:
- All-access passes (access to all series)
- Single-event passes (access to specific series)
- Category-based access (VIP vs General)

**Example**: Festival pass that works for all 3 days

## Database Architecture

### Entity Relationships

```
organizations
    └── events (main events)
         ├── event_series (multiple series per event)
         │    ├── series_gates (gates per series)
         │    ├── series_category_limits (capacity per series)
         │    ├── series_wristband_assignments (access control)
         │    ├── series_tickets (ticket linkage)
         │    └── series_metrics_cache (analytics)
         └── series_templates (reusable configs)
```

### Key Functions

1. **`is_series_within_checkin_window(series_id)`**
   - Returns if series is currently scannable
   - Used for displaying active series

2. **`get_active_series_for_event(event_id)`**
   - Returns all active series for event
   - Includes check-in window status

3. **`compute_series_metrics(series_id)`**
   - Calculates real-time metrics
   - Updates cache table

4. **`create_recurring_series_instances(parent_id, count)`**
   - Generates recurring instances
   - Copies all settings from parent

5. **`verify_wristband_access(wristband_id, series_id)`**
   - Validates wristband access
   - Returns detailed validation result

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Series Creation

```typescript
import { enhancedSeriesService } from '@/services/enhancedSeriesService';

const result = await enhancedSeriesService.createSeries({
  main_event_id: 'event-uuid',
  name: 'Day 1 - Friday',
  start_date: '2024-06-01T18:00:00Z',
  end_date: '2024-06-02T02:00:00Z',
  capacity: 5000,
  sequence_number: 1,
});
```

### Bulk Wristband Assignment

```typescript
// Assign by category
await enhancedSeriesService.bulkAssignByCategory({
  series_id: 'series-uuid',
  event_id: 'event-uuid',
  categories: ['VIP', '3-Day Pass'],
});

// Assign by ticket numbers
await enhancedSeriesService.bulkAssignByTickets({
  series_id: 'series-uuid',
  event_id: 'event-uuid',
  ticket_numbers: ['TKT-001', 'TKT-002'],
});
```

### Access Verification

```typescript
const verification = await enhancedSeriesService.verifyWristbandAccess(
  wristbandId,
  seriesId
);

if (verification.data?.valid) {
  // Allow check-in
} else {
  // Show error: verification.data?.message
}
```

### Recurring Series

```typescript
// Create parent with recurrence pattern
const parent = await enhancedSeriesService.createSeries({
  main_event_id: 'event-uuid',
  name: 'Weekly Concert',
  start_date: '2024-06-01T20:00:00Z',
  end_date: '2024-06-01T23:00:00Z',
  is_recurring: true,
  recurrence_pattern: {
    type: 'weekly',
    interval: 1,
    end_after_occurrences: 12,
  },
});

// Generate instances
await enhancedSeriesService.createRecurringInstances({
  parent_series_id: parent.data.id,
  occurrences: 12,
});
```

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Run Migration

```bash
# Via psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/comprehensive_event_series_system.sql

# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db execute --file database/migrations/comprehensive_event_series_system.sql
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE '%series%';
```

Should return 8 tables:
- event_series
- series_gates
- series_category_limits
- series_wristband_assignments
- series_tickets
- series_metrics_cache
- series_templates
- series_state_transitions

### 3. Test Basic Operations

```typescript
// Import service
import { enhancedSeriesService } from '@/services/enhancedSeriesService';

// Create test series
const result = await enhancedSeriesService.createSeries({
  main_event_id: 'your-test-event-id',
  name: 'Test Series',
  start_date: new Date().toISOString(),
  end_date: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000).toISOString(),
});

console.log('Series created:', result.data);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Metrics Caching
The system includes a `series_metrics_cache` table that stores pre-computed analytics:
- Updated automatically on check-ins (via trigger)
- Can be manually refreshed with `computeSeriesMetrics()`
- Prevents expensive calculations on large datasets

### Indexes
All foreign keys and frequently queried columns are indexed:
- Series by main_event_id
- Series by organization_id
- Series by lifecycle_status
- Wristband assignments by series_id
- Gates by series_id

### Query Optimization
Use views for complex queries:
- `series_overview` - Aggregated series data
- `series_with_metrics` - Series joined with metrics

---

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies ensuring:
- Users can only access series in their organization
- Public templates visible to all
- Write operations restricted by role

### Audit Trails
- `series_state_transitions` - Logs all status changes
- Tracks who changed what and when
- Supports automated vs manual changes

### Access Validation
- `verify_wristband_access()` function validates access
- Checks wristband status, series assignment, active state
- Returns detailed reason for denial

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Sequence Numbers
```typescript
sequence_number: 1,  // Helps with sorting and organization
```

### 2. Set Appropriate Check-in Windows
```typescript
// Lenient for large events
checkin_window_start_offset: '4 hours',
checkin_window_end_offset: '2 hours',

// Strict for controlled events
checkin_window_start_offset: '30 minutes',
checkin_window_end_offset: '0 minutes',
```

### 3. Use Templates for Repeated Patterns
Create once, reuse forever

### 4. Precompute Metrics Regularly
Run `computeSeriesMetrics()` on a schedule for active series

### 5. Manage Lifecycle Properly
draft → scheduled → active → completed (in order)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

The system is designed to support future additions:

1. **Series Dependencies** - Series B can only start after Series A completes
2. **Dynamic Pricing** - Time-based or demand-based pricing per series
3. **Waitlists** - Automatic promotion when capacity opens
4. **Cross-Series Analytics** - Compare performance across series
5. **Series Cloning** - Duplicate series with all settings
6. **Conditional Access** - Complex rules for wristband validation
7. **Series Notifications** - Alerts when series status changes
8. **Integration APIs** - REST/GraphQL endpoints for external systems
