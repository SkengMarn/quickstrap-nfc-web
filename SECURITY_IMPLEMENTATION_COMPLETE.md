**Security Impact:** 🟠 HIGH → ✅ SECURE

---

### 4. ✅ Production Hardening
**Files Modified:**
- `vite.config.ts`
- `.gitignore`

**Changes:**
- Disabled source maps in production builds
- Strengthened dev server filesystem access (`fs.strict: true`)
- Added debug files to `.gitignore` (debug.html, test-env.html, minimal.html)
- Production builds no longer expose source code

**Security Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM → ✅ SECURE

---

### 5. ✅ Cryptographic Security Enhancement
**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/secureStorage.ts`

**Changes:**
- Replaced weak XOR encryption with Web Crypto API

- `src/components/EventForm.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Created comprehensive CSRF token system
- Added cryptographically secure token generation
- Implemented token validation and expiration (24 hours)
- Added CSRF tokens to form submissions
- Created React hooks and HOCs for easy integration

**Security Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM → ✅ SECURE

---

### 7. ✅ Security Infrastructure

## 🔍 Security Testing Recommendations

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run these commands regularly
npm audit
npx snyk test
npm run lint
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test SQL injection on all search fields
- [ ] Test CSV formula injection with malicious files
- [ ] Verify CSP blocks inline scripts without nonces
- [ ] Test CSRF protection on form submissions
- [ ] Verify source maps are disabled in production
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption of sensitive data

### Penetration Testing Tools
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- SQLMap (for SQL injection testing)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Launch
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Rotate all exposed credentials (Supabase keys, Telegram token)
- [ ] Test all security fixes in staging environment
- [ ] Verify CSP nonces work correctly
- [ ] Test CSRF protection on all forms
- [ ] Confirm source maps are disabled in production build

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor for security headers in production
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular dependency audits (weekly)
- [ ] Security penetration testing (quarterly)

---

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- Run `npm audit` and fix vulnerabilities
- Review security logs
- Monitor failed authentication attempts

### Monthly
- Update dependencies
- Review and rotate API keys
- Security code review

### Quarterly
- Full security penetration testing
- Review and update security policies
- Security training for development team
