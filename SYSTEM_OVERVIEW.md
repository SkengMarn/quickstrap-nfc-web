## üéØ Why Each Feature Exists

### **Dashboard**
**Problem**: Need quick overview without drilling into details
**Solution**: High-level metrics and recent activity in one place

### **Event Health Score**
**Problem**: Too many metrics to track during live event
**Solution**: Single composite score for instant status check

### **Auto-Gate Discovery**
**Problem**: Manual gate setup is time-consuming and error-prone
**Solution**: App discovers gates automatically, portal approves

### **Ticket Linking**
**Problem**: Guest lists from ticketing platforms don't match physical wristbands
**Solution**: Link tickets to wristbands by email, track both systems

### **Fraud Detection**
**Problem**: People share wristbands or try to enter multiple times
**Solution**: Real-time pattern analysis catches suspicious behavior

### **Emergency Controls**
**Problem**: Need to react instantly to safety issues
**Solution**: One-click lockdown, broadcast alerts, capacity override

### **Real-time Feed**
**Problem**: Don't know what's happening until it's too late
**Solution**: Live activity feed shows every check-in as it happens

### **Category Limits**
**Problem**: VIP area gets overcrowded while general admission is empty
**Solution**: Set per-category capacity limits and enforce at gates

### **Gate Bindings**
**Problem**: VIP wristbands entering general admission areas
**Solution**: Configure which categories allowed at each gate

### **Staff Access Levels**
**Problem**: Don't want all staff to have admin access
**Solution**: Three levels (Owner/Admin/Scanner) with different permissions

### **Organization Support**
**Problem**: Multiple event organizers need to share resources
**Solution**: Multi-tenant organizations with member management

## üîÆ Current State vs. Ideal State

### **What Works Now**
‚úÖ Event creation and management
‚úÖ Wristband uploads and inventory
‚úÖ Guest list uploads and ticket linking
‚úÖ Check-in logging and tracking
‚úÖ Staff access management
‚úÖ Real-time activity feeds
‚úÖ Basic analytics and reporting
‚úÖ Fraud detection alerts
‚úÖ Emergency controls

### **What Needs Fixing**
‚ùå **Gate health scores**: Showing hardcoded 92% instead of real data
   - **Why**: `gates.health_score` column doesn't exist in database
   - **Fix**: Either add column or remove fake scores

‚ùå **System health metrics**: Uptime/response time showing placeholders
   - **Why**: No backend service tracking these metrics
   - **Fix**: Implement health monitoring service

‚ùå **Some database columns missing**: 
   - `gates.location_lataslatitude` (typo in column name)
   - `checkin_logs.timestamp` (should be `created_at`)
   - `system_alerts` table doesn't exist
   - **Fix**: Run schema migration to add missing columns/tables

‚ùå **Auto-gate discovery approval**: UI exists but workflow incomplete
   - **Why**: App creates gates but approval process needs testing
   - **Fix**: Test end-to-end workflow with mobile app

### **What's Placeholder Data**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gate Health**: 92% (hardcoded)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Score**: 98% (hardcoded)
‚ö†Ô∏è **System Uptime**: "--" (not tracked)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Response Time**: 0ms (not measured)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Active Connections**: 0 (not counted)

---

## üéì Understanding the Numbers

### **Why show 0 check-ins but 92% gate health?**
**Answer**: Gate health is **hardcoded placeholder data** (line 49 in EventDetailsPage.tsx). It should show 0% or "N/A" when there's no real data yet. The code tries to calculate real health but fails because the database column doesn't exist.

### **Why do I have stats when nothing has happened?**
**Answer**: Some stats are **real** (counting database records), others are **placeholders** (hardcoded defaults). Real stats will be 0 until you have data. Placeholder stats show fake numbers until the feature is fully implemented.

### **What's the difference between Portal and App?**
**Answer**: 
- **Portal (Web)**: You configure everything here. It's the brain.
- **App (Mobile)**: Staff use this to scan wristbands. It's the hands.
- Portal creates, App executes. Portal monitors, App reports back.
