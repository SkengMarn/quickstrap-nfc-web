- Common pattern for help/support buttons
- Easy to spot but not annoying

### Why Blinking/Pulsing?
- Draws attention without being aggressive
- Indicates interactive element
- Subtle enough not to distract
- Helps new users discover the tour

### Why Always Visible?
- Users can retake the tour anytime
- Helpful for new features/updates
- Reduces support requests
- Improves onboarding experience
